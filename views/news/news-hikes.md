## Hiking
Hiking outdoors has plenty of perks: nice views, fresh air, and the sounds and smells of nature.

+ It's good for you, too. Hiking is a powerful cardio workout that can:
  - Lower your risk of heart disease
  - Improve your blood pressure and blood sugar levels
  - Boost bone density, since walking is a weight-bearing exercise
  - Build strength in your glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, and the muscles in your hips and lower legs
  - Strengthen your core
  - Improve balance
  - Help control your weight
  - Boost your mood. "Research shows that hiking has a positive impact on combating the symptoms of stress and anxiety," says Gregory A. Miller, PhD, president of the American- Hiking Society. "Being in nature is ingrained in our DNA, and we sometimes forget that."

### Step Up Your Hiking Workout

You can get more out of your hiking with these fitness-boosting strategies.

### Start slow. 
A short, local hike is best for beginners. Gradually work up to trails with hills or uneven terrain.

### Use poles. 
Digging into the ground and propelling yourself forward pushes your upper body muscles to work harder and gives you a stronger cardio workout.

### Head for the hills. 
Even a small hill will intensify your heart rate and burn extra calories. Miller says a 5% to 10% incline equals a 30% to 40% increase in calorie burn.

### Bump it up. 
Uneven terrain can work muscles while improving balance and stability.

### Weigh yourself down. 
Stock your day pack with extra weight. (Water’s a good option.) According to Miller, a 10- to 15-pound day pack will boost your calorie burn by 10% to 15% while strengthening your lower back muscles.

### Get into a groove. 
On the days you can’t make it to the trails, power-walk on a hilly terrain while carrying various degrees of weight in a backpack -- it will keep your hiking skills and fitness level on track.

#### Safe Hiking Tips
**Bring a buddy.** It’s best not to hike alone at first, especially on unfamiliar or remote trails. A partner or group can help you navigate and assist if you get hurt. As your skill level improves, you’ll feel more comfortable going solo.

**Know before you go.** Familiarize yourself with the trail map. Check the weather, and dress and pack accordingly. If storms are a possibility, rethink your plan. Follow marked paths and trails.
